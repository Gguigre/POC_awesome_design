## PoC
Proof of concept (PoC) is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle with the aim of verifying that some concept or theory has practical potential. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.

## Why
I tried to reproduce an example of awesome design given during an UX formation at [BAM](https://github.com/bamlab)

## Result
